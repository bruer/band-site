        Robert Nesta Marley, OM (6 February 1945 â€“ 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican
        singer and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his
        musical career was marked by blending elements of reggae, ska, and
        rocksteady, as well as forging a smooth and distinctive vocal and
        songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the
        visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in
        popular culture for over a decade.

        Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional
        musical career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The
        group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which
        contained the single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was immensely
        popular, peaking in the top five on worldwide music charts, and
        established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers
        subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially
        employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging
        in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
        which coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafarianism. During
        this period Marley relocated to London, and the group typified their
        musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers
        (1971).

        The group attained international success after the release of the albums
        Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring
        artists. A year later the Wailers disbanded, and Marley went on to
        release his solo material under the band's name. His debut studio album
        Natty Dread (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up
        Rastaman Vibration (1976). A few months after the album's release Marley
        survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted
        him to permanently relocate to London soon afterward. There he recorded
        the album Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and
        British rock, enjoyed widespread commercial success, and is widely
        considered one of the best albums of all time.

      Robert Nesta Marley, OM (6 February 1945 â€“ 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican
      singer and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his
      musical career was marked by blending elements of reggae, ska, and
      rocksteady, as well as forging a smooth and distinctive vocal and
      songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the
      visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in
      popular culture for over a decade.

      Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical
      career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The group
      released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which
      contained the single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was immensely
      popular, peaking in the top five on worldwide music charts, and
      established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers
      subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially
      employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in
      rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which
      coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafarianism. During this
      period Marley relocated to London, and the group typified their musical
      shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).

      The group attained international success after the release of the albums
      Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring
      artists. A year later the Wailers disbanded, and Marley went on to release
      his solo material under the band's name. His debut studio album Natty
      Dread (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up Rastaman
      Vibration (1976). A few months after the album's release Marley survived
      an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to
      permanently relocate to London soon afterward. There he recorded the album
      Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock,
      enjoyed widespread commercial success, and is widely considered one of the
      best albums of all time.

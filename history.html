    Robert Nesta Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican
    singer and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical
    career was marked by blending elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as
    well as forging a smooth and distinctive vocal and songwriting style.
    Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music
    worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a
    decade.

    Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical
    career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The group released
    its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the
    single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was immensely popular, peaking
    in the top five on worldwide music charts, and established the group as a
    rising figure in reggae. The Wailers subsequently released eleven further
    studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing,
    the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late
    1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with the singer's conversion to
    Rastafarianism. During this period Marley relocated to London, and the group
    typified their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The
    Wailers (1971).

    The group attained international success after the release of the albums
    Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring
    artists. A year later the Wailers disbanded, and Marley went on to release
    his solo material under the band's name. His debut studio album Natty Dread
    (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up Rastaman Vibration
    (1976). A few months after the album's release Marley survived an
    assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to
    permanently relocate to London soon afterward. There he recorded the album
    Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock,
    enjoyed widespread commercial success, and is widely considered one of the
    best albums of all time.

    Over the course of his career Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and
    the singer sought to infuse his music with a sense of spirituality. He is
    also considered a global symbol of Jamaican culture and identity, and was
    controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of marijuana,
    while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism.

    In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he died as a
    result of the illness in 1981. His fans around the world expressed their
    grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica. The greatest hits album
    Legend was released in 1984, and subsequently became the best-selling reggae
    album of all-time. Marley also ranks as one of the best-selling music
    artists of all-time, with estimated sales of more than 75 million records
    worldwide, while his sound and style have influenced artists of various
    genres. He was posthumously honored by Jamaica soon after his death, as he
    was designated the nation's Order of Merit award.
